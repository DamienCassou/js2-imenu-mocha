* js2-imenu-mocha
Improves on the imenu entries generated by [[https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode/][js2-mode]] by adding test
blocks created with calls to ~describe()~ and ~it()~ functions. Those
functions are usually found in JavaScript test frameworks.

You can see on the screenshot above that an imenu index has been
created for the test file containing all test blocks. The imenu
entries have the same tree structure as the test blocks as can be seen
in the screenshot below:

The imenu buffer above is created with [[https://github.com/bmag/imenu-list][imenu-list]].

** How to use

In a buffer, you can turn this mode on by typing ~M-x
js2-imenu-mocha-mode~. You can also add this function to ~js2-mode-hook~.
